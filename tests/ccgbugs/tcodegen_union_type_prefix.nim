  . From https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/8781
    Duplicate member error for union types
  . Not entirely sure if this is a bug, or if its just assumed
    that the programmer should not have variable names that end
    in a capital U.
  . Fixed by replacing 'U' suffix by  "_U" prefix, which is not
    allowed as an identifier: https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/8787
