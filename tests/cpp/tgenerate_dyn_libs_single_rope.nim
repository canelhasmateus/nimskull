    Strange codegen ICE with importcpp #8241
  . The compiler assumes that once the nodes reach genCall the symbol
    sym.loc.r points to a valid leafy rope but that's not the case when
    mangleDynLibProc is thrown in the mix. We could just make mangleDynLibProc
    always produce a single rope piece.

  . From https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/9222
  . Compiler is using a global temp string to hold the result of the findlib
    invocation. If you have several modules using different libraries
    with different findlib functions, you will get a link time error saying
    that you have multiple definitions of the same global variable _T1.
    The fix is to use local variable.

  . From https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/8946
    compiler workchain
  . i would suggest to introduce a step of reordering the
    lines in a way that import, const, var, let, proc are arranged at top
    before compiling the source. i guess it may scramble up with the line
    addresses in error messaging and a scheme to readdress the lines might
    be needed. Anyway imo the current situation is inconvenient and reminds
    me of writing pascal in the '80s.
